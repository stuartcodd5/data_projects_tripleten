#### Purchase Activity Sheet
This sheet shows the purchase activity of each user ID. Part of my project was to add columns G through J. They include:
1. Column G uses a VLOOKUP to retrieve the first purchase date from the first purchase sheet.
2. Column H is the Event month condenses the event date into YYYY-MM using a TEXT function
3. Column I First purchase month does the same thing but with the first purchase
4. Column J is the cohort age which is found by using a DATEDIF function to find how many months are between each event and purchase date. (This column is utilized in the retention rates sheet)
